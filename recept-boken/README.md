### About the project
It is a cross-platform web application developed to assist users find food and bakery recipes. The user can get all the recipes that are included in Themealdb.com database. 

### Features
The user of the application gets equipped with a recipe for a quick lunch dish or a festive fine dinner. Whether he/she is craving a homemade classic or the latest trend food. Both as inspiration for summer barbecue evenings and a winter dinner with candles.

Together with recipe instructions and ingredients, the user can also see the video instructions of each particular recipe. He/she see the video by clicking on the "LÃ¤s mer matten" button. In addition to that, if the user feels that it is a good recipe, he/she can then add it to the favorite list that will get stored in the local storage of the used web browser. The user can also wipe out the recipe from the list. 

The user can not add a recipe to the favorites if it already exists there. 

### The used API
We used:
- TheMealDB.com. It is an open, crowd-sourced database of Recipes from around the world.

# Framework/Library choice
We use React to develop this project.

### Why React, not Vue or Angular?

There can be multiple reasons why the team chose React instead of Vue or Angular, here are some of the reasons: 

Firstly and most importantly, the biggest reason was that we had different kinds of projects and assignments at the same time. Since we had extreme workload in other courses, and our team had experiences in React from previously project and courses, we thought it is best to use React though we would not manage to learn Vue and Angular in a limited time. 

Secondly, React is better than Vue or Angular because of its interesting virtual DOM abilities, it has easy-to-follow documentation, it has large community support, it consists of light weight attributes and so on so forth these are the features that has made React the most popular frontend framework of JavaScript.

However, it would be nice and great if we could have used Vue and Angular in order to expand the knowledge about more frameworks and libraries. We can briefly say that we do not limit our knowledge to a certain framework but it is our next goal to start using Vue first and then Angular in our coming projects.

Download the repository and follow the earlier mentioned steps and enjoy diverse recipes. Good Luck!
